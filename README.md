# Get Next Line

A function that reads a file descriptor and returns the next line from the file each time it is called. This project is designed to help students practice file handling, dynamic memory allocation, and working with buffers in C.

## Requirements

- A file descriptor is passed to the function.
- The function should return a line of the file each time it is called, including the newline character.
- The function should handle multiple calls, reading the file until all content is consumed.
- Memory management is important; the function should not leak memory and should properly handle buffers.
